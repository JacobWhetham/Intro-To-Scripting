# Intro-To-Scripting
A compilation of my take on the educational modules of SNHU's Intro to Scripting class.

These are not meant to be submissions for the projects. This work is based on what is taught in the modules provided to me.

To better help my fellow computer science students, I have created these scripts and documented them to help deepen the understanding of the course material.
I intend to update this repository as I learn more about the modules until I cover all modules of the course.

I am by no means an expert, but I am more than happy to help where I am able.

If you are a fellow Computer Science student and wish to join the study group, feel free to join us on discord: https://discord.gg/KJKHwkfZ7z

Please contact me if you have any questions, feedback, or requests.

Thanks!
